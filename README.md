# Milestone-Project

This is a solo project! (Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together.)
This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class.
This game must run in a web browser.
This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum of 10 commits.
Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location.


Project Description
my game is based around zombie survival games where i have a player run around and try to survive the zombies.

Game Logic
Replace this text with pseudocode.
the logic of the game is to have an infinite spawn of zombies until the player is dead with a tracker on how many zombies the player has killed.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - the choices the player has is to either run or shoot
  - he either gets a kill or avoids a zombie otherwise he looses health and or dies if his health is low enough 
it really has to victory or loss status but a kill tracker so the objective is to get as many zombies before they get you and success is based upon if you did better than before.

Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term Minimum Viable Product (MVP) -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.

Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as Post-MVP Ideas. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!

For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

MVP Criteria
One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
it must have a character and be able to shoot zombies and add those zombies to a kill tracker
Another thing.
the playable character must have a health bar
Etc.
Post-MVP Plans
One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
is to have the character be able to move away from the zombies 
Another that will be a stretch.
will be able to choose my difficulty setting so that i can pick an easier mode.
Something else I don't technically know how to do... yet. :)
adding in items that can be picked up to upgrade my character
